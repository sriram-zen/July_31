**scope**: Covers all core platform operations, data, and environments.
**title**: Deployment, Backups, and Disaster Recovery
**spec_id**: operational-deployment-disaster-recovery
**priority**: must-have
**assumptions**:
- Cloud infrastructure supports automated backups and rapid restore.
**constraints**:
- Dependent on robust automation and infrastructure practices.
**description**: The platform must support streamlined deployment, routine automated backups, and a documented disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime and data loss. Both admin and public systems require clear operational runbooks for deployment, rollback, and critical incident response.
**last_updated**: 2025-07-31T16:32:29.832491+00:00
**business_rules**:
- Backups and recovery drills must be verified and logged quarterly.
**specifications**:
- Automate daily backups of all production databases and files; store backups in an encrypted, offsite location.
- Document and test disaster recovery plan, including restoration of data and services after failure.
- Develop and maintain operational runbooks for deployment, rollback, and incident response.
- Ensure backup verification and recovery drills are conducted at least quarterly.
- Monitor backup and disaster recovery processes with alerting for failures or gaps.
**business_objective**: Ensure high availability, minimize data loss, and support rapid incident recovery for operational resilience.
**exception_handling**:
- Backup failures or disaster events trigger incident response runbooks and escalation.
**validation_criteria**:
- Automated backup of all core data (devotee, donation, event, audit logs) occurs at least daily and is stored securely offsite.
- Disaster recovery plan enables platform restoration to within 1 hour of the last backup for critical data.
- Deployment/rollback procedures are documented and tested before each major release.
- All critical incidents are responded to within 30 minutes and resolved or escalated according to incident runbook.
**business_justification**: Operational readiness reduces risk of data loss, downtime, and reputational harm, enabling trust and adoption.

### **integration-data-validation-duplicate-management**

**type**: integration
**scope**: All platform integration workflows involving external APIs or cross-module data exchange.
**title**: Data Validation and Duplicate Management for Integrations
